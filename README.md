# SpamClick
A Python scripts to record and replay on-screen clicks

To use the script:
1. Run SpamClick.py
2. Click on the screen where you want the script to click repeatedly. You can record a lot, not just one place.
3. When you've recorded all your clicks, press Enter to run the SpamClick. Mouse control will now be taken over by the script.
   - Note: To pause the script and save the clicks, press the Home key, this will return control of the mouse. To resume, press the End key.
4. To stop the script, press Esc. This will delete the saved click points, so consider pausing (see above) if you want to reuse them.
